1)What are the main pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?
A)
The main pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:

1. Encapsulation: It bundles data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit, controlling access and preventing external interference.
   
2. Inheritance: It allows a class to inherit properties and behaviour from another class, promoting code reusability and facilitating hierarchical relationships.
   
3. Polymorphism: It enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, allowing methods to be called on objects without knowing their specific type, enhancing flexibility and extensibility.
   
4. Abstraction: It hides complex implementation details and exposes only relevant features of an object, enabling modular design and reducing complexity.

2)What is the significance of abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming?
A)
Abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is significant because it allows developers to focus on essential aspects of an object while hiding unnecessary implementation details.
This promotes clarity, simplifies code maintenance, and facilitates communication among team members by providing a high-level overview of the system's functionality.
Abstraction also enhances code reusability and adaptability, as changes to the underlying implementation can be made without affecting the overall structure or behaviour of the system.

3) What are static methods in Object-Oriented Programming and how do they differ from instance methods?
A)
Static methods in Object-Oriented Programming are associated with the class itself rather than instances of the class.
They can be called using the class name and do not require an object to be instantiated.
Static methods cannot access instance variables and are typically used for utility functions or operations independent of instance-specific data.
In contrast, instance methods operate on the state of individual instances and can access both instance variables and static variables.
Static methods provide a way to organize and encapsulate functionality at the class level, promoting code modularity and reusability.
